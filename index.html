  This pupper has something to say in the debate on Cats being cool and Dogs not being so.

  <p>
  "Joe" here takes his claim to being a Cool Dude, but does he speak for all dogs. In an interveiw with this fellow our staff learned that Joe here doesn't talk, so no information other than his cool look was learned.

<h1>
This Question of Coolness is Important, but Are Goats Cool?
</h1>

A goat sorta just wormed into the office so we figured we'd just question it.
</text>
<p>
Once again, it seems that animals don't seem to talk, but we learned from the fluid movements of the goat that goats are quite the dancers. So that sounds like a soild maybe on the cool chart.

Polar Bears are probably the cutest bears, I mean they are ice boiz that found a way to mate with normal basic bears when their homes were forced to warmer places.

<p>
That sounds like a cool boi to me.
</p>
<p>
Tbh I'm sure we can all agree that polar bears are the best boiz hands down.
